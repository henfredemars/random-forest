# random-forest

Random forest implementation in Lua 5.1
=======================================

This is (going to become) a Lua implementation of random forests using ID3 decision trees (also implemented here in Lua) 
targeting Lua 5.1 compatibility. This project is educational in nature---I make no claims as to its suitability for any 
purpose. If you are considering this rock for inclusion in your project, please understand that is not suitable for 
production.

Why did you decide on this project?
-----------------------------------

- Closer understanding of a popular machine learning approach
- Hands-on experience with a small, fast, and highly-embeddable dynamic language
- Hobby project to keep me occupied spring of 2017

Overwhelmingly, this project is about learning and having fun with Lua!
